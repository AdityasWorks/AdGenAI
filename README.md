# Creative Ad Generator

The **Creative Ad Generator** is a powerful web application designed to automate the creation of advertisements using state-of-the-art generative AI technologies. By leveraging GPT-4 for text generation, DALL-E for image generation, and Runway ML for video generation, this tool offers a comprehensive solution for producing engaging and dynamic ad content.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Uses GPT-4 to create engaging ad copy based on the provided input and context.
- **Image Generation**: Generates custom ad images using DALL-E, based on textual descriptions.
- **Video Generation**: Creates ad videos using Runway ML's video generation models.
- **Customizable Content**: Users can tailor the generated content to match their brand's voice and style.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure OpenAI**: GPT-4 for text generation and content creation.
- **RapidAPI**: API integration for seamless communication with generative AI services.
- **Runway ML**: For video generation and other media creation tasks.
- **DALL-E**: For generating images based on text descriptions.
- **React**: Frontend for interactive and responsive UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a modern, utility-first CSS framework to style the application.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing and better code maintainability.
- **Python**: For backend processes, integration, and handling AI model requests.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0 or above)
- Python (v3.8 or above)
- API keys for GPT-4, DALL-E, and Runway ML (sign up at their respective platforms for access)

## How It Works

1. **Text Generation**: Users input a brief description or context for their ad, and GPT-4 generates the corresponding text.
2. **Image Generation**: The generated text is then used to create an image with DALL-E based on the provided description.
3. **Video Generation**: For more dynamic ads, the text and images are used to create a short video using Runway ML.
4. **Final Output**: The app compiles the generated text, image, and video into a unified advertisement for the user to download or share.
